just like the Vite or CRA in js applications, we have the maven for the spring boot application
it is not just a build management tool used for build generation but it is used for different other purposes in project 
management like documentation, dependency resolution, build generation, etc. 

maven works on the POM (Project Object Model)

just like as for running the npm command in node system, we have to look for the package.json file in the current directory, 
in the same way, when the mvn command is run in the current directory for the spring boot application, it looks for the 
pom.xml file and on getting the file, it fetches the configuration from there 

before maven, we had ant 
for ant, we were supposed to tell it what to do and how to do 
in case of maven, we just need to tell what to do, the how part is handled by the maven itself 

understanding the project structure created by maven:
done 

understanding the pom.xml structure:
done in the pom.xml file in the form of comments
