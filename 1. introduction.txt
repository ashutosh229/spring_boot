before the arrival of the frameworks like spring and spring boot, we had servlets and servlet container 
these were the foundations for building web applications 
servlet is a java class which handles the client request, process it and return the response
there are multiple servlets and we need someone which can manage all these servlets 
servlet container are the ones which manages the servlets
