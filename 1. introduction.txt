before the arrival of the frameworks like spring and spring boot, we had servlets and servlet container 
these were the foundations for building web applications 
servlet is a java class which handles the client request, process it and return the response
there are multiple servlets and we need someone which can manage all these servlets 
servlet container are the ones which manages the servlets

working of the servelet technology:
input request goes to the servlet container 
it uses the web.xml file to find the servlet which should be used to serve the request 
then the input request is routed to the particular servlet 
then the response is triggered from the servlet to the container 
then the container fires the response to the client 

web.xml file contains the servlet mapping and other sort of configurations for the servlets 
servlet mapping configures for the servlets which endpoint should be used where 

servlets had a lot of problems which were becoming burden in the path of web applications development
to solve these problems, the spring framework came into the picture
