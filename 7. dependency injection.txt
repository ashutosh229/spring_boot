java is an object oriented programming language 
spring boot is a framework of java 
spring boot also deals with the object oriented paradigm 
while writing applications in spring boot, we create objects 
objects are dependent on one another 
for e.g., if we create the object for a computer, it should have the object of the desktop, keyboard, mouse, etc. 
therefore, the computer object is dependent on these other objects
this is called object dependency and its management is called the dependency management
dependency management is one of the most important aspects in any object oriented application because for the application
to work properly, it is important that the objects are well managed  

manual dependency management: 
in the manual way, the developer creates the objects manually using the new keyboard (both the independent and the dependent objects)
injects the dependent objects into the independent object using the setter methods 
then runs the application code where all the dependencies are now well managed and injected 
the flow of control was from the developer who creates, injects and manages the objects, to the application which runs 
after the process is done 
this is called the manual control or the regular control

the manual dependency injection can take place in two ways:
1. property injection: 
-the dependent objects are created and initialized as the states/properties inside the dependent class 
-in the application code, we dont need to create the independent objects and inject them manually because they are already 
present as states 
-we can directly create the object of the dependent class and use it 
2. setter injection:
-this is a better approach 
-here we just create the independent objects into the  dependent class and dont initialize it and 
also create a setter function in the dependent class for setting the independent objects 
-in the  application code, we create the independent and dependent objects both 
-use the setter function for injection of the independent objects into the dependent one 
-then since then dependency injection is done, we can now use the 

automatic/autoconfigured dependency management:
this is also called the dependency injection 
in this case, the spring framework, via configurations in the application code through annotations and all automates the  
process of objects creation, their injection, management,etc. and the develop do not have to manage the whole thing 
here the control is shifted from the developer to the application 
the flow of control is that the application creates, injects and manages the objects and then developer is able to use those 
objects in the application and run it 
since the control flow is inverted than the manual, it is also called the inversion of control 

inversion of control or IOC is one of the most important features of the spring boot framework
